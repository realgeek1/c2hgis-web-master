======
The Connect2HealthFCC Task Force’s mapping platform *Mapping Broadband Health in America 2017* allows users to visualize, overlay and analyze broadband and health data at the national, state and county levels – informing policy prescriptions and investment decisions.

The maps are an interactive experience, showing various pictures of the intersection between connectivity and health for every county in the United States. Users can generate customized maps that show broadband access, adoption and speed alongside various health measures (e.g., obesity, diabetes and physician access) in urban and rural areas.

These maps can be used by both public and private sectors, and local communities, to identify opportunities and gaps in connected care.

## Data sources
The broadband data is current as of December 2015 and comes from the Commission’s Form 477 data on residential fixed broadband deployment and residential fixed broadband subscribership. Proportions for broadband access statistics are calculated using 2014 demographic data from GeoLytics, E. Brunswick, NJ. The health data is drawn from the 2017 release of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation County Health Rankings & Roadmap (which reflects data from the Health Resources and Services Administration, Dartmouth Atlas Project, American Medical Association, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other primary sources); and additional demographic data is from the U.S. Census Bureau.
